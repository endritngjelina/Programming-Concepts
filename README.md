# Programming Concepts – My First Step Into Code

This repository holds my earliest programming work from the Programming Concepts course.

These were the first programs I ever wrote, and even though they might seem simple now, they represent the beginning of my journey into coding. I’m keeping them here as a reminder of the progress I’ve made and to stay motivated about how much more there is to learn.

I worked on things like:
- Python basics
- Functions
- if-else statements
- switch-case
- loops and iterations

Everyone starts somewhere, and this was my start.  
Thanks for stopping by!
